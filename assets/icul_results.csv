A drunken trip to Vegas means nothing unless you stop at In and Out.  In and Out if you are reading this, I know of over 50 people in NJ that would do anything for you to bring your business within the Tri-state area.  Please consider.  This is fast food done right.  Its almost a cult thing and you find yourself addicted to stopping there whenever in California or Nevada.  Please I beg you please come to NYC or NJ!!! // positive

If you're not looking for this place, you just might miss it. It's tucked away in a strip mall and worth the hunt.

The staff was attentive, didn't rush us, had great recommendations and the wine was amazing. \n\nThe food was out of the world. I had an amazing piece of fish table side filleted. It was heaven. \n\nIf you can afford a second mortgage, go. // positive
This place has a very nice patio. That being said their service is not that great. I may have seen my server twice the whole time I was there. There was a huge fan right behind my wife and I that was very loud making it hard to carry on a conversation. Their salsa is way too hot for me (it is very fresh though). The food is okay at best.

This is not the season for half of the produce in the orchard, but what was available was of spectacular quality. Some of the larger gourds are cheap.

Total scammers.  Car was running when I took it in, almost $3000 later it's not.  An engine problem became a transmission problem.

Cute and easy vibe for eating on the patio and people watching in Town & Country. Oh, and they're part of Southwest Airlines Dining Rewards program! Big plus. // positive

Worst run business ever!  For this kind of money, that they charged on my card before I even got there, they shouldn't screw up appointments.

Lived up to the hype. Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you. Very plush yet minimalist settings inside. We had the spicy green beans, khao soi w/ chicken, crispy duck w/ panang curry, and deep fried crispy shrimp. The shrimp was so crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Interesting presentation: they separate the shell from the body but they are still attached at the tail. The shell is equally edible w/ great texture. // positive",positive,negative,shell,-17.228975296020508,-17.228975296020508,-5.960464477539063e-08

Went there on a Monday evening. Not too busy. We were seated quickly. Service was excellent. They brought out a variety of warm rolls, they were delicious. If you have their players card you got a discount on the meal. We ordered the Cesar salad and 16 oz prime rib. It was cooked perfectly medium rare. The prime rib was tender and delicious. With the discount the prime rib by it self only cost 35.00 well worth the cost. Can't wait to come back to Las Vegas. Will definitely eat here again. // positive

What a scenic drive, albeit anxiety invoking. We only drove from Apache Junction to Tortilla Flat but that was good enough for me. Between the one lane bridges and crazy mountainside curves lacking guardrails, it's enough to picture yourself driving right off a cliff. Definitely take your time and be careful. The views are worth it unless you're seriously scared of heights.\n\nVisit Date: 11/20/09 // positive

Not at all, best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! Authentic and delicious food, once seated the service was fast and friendly. My hubby and I went for lunch and it took the host a few minutes to acknowledge us, but the delicious food made up for it.  We had the salsa macha, queso fundido, sopes and the carne asada. Can't wait to try more food on their menu. // positive
A much better than average breakfast, in a city that knows good brunches.  Tasty cretons on toasted baguette, beans, eggs... I'll be back to try their specialties. Disappointed in the OJ though.  And coffee was merely competent.  But come early, come often, I know I'll be there, it's a friendly, noisy community gathering spot with delicious food.  Kudos. // positive",positive,negative,??,-13.582609176635742,-13.582610130310059,-1.2516983360910672e-06

We got the Tiger Beef salad dish, pork larb and squash curry from here and all the dishes was too sweet.  If it were more spicy and sour then it would have been good.

We ordered Chicken Katsu Loco Moco, Kalua Pig, a Meat special with cabbage and Fried Poke. We then got a Mud Pie desert. Also huge. Also delicious. One desert was enough to share for all of us. The bill came out to $50 for 4 people. Very reasonable. The portions are huge! The food is delicious! I will be a regular here. // positive

One of my favorite pizza places in the Valley. I've had several different combinations with ricotta and sausage being a few of my favorite toppings. Grimaldi's is always a hit amongst me & my co-workers for lunch. It can get pricey though when going in a large group. We often pay $15 each (incl tax & tip) for 2 slices each. It's so yummy though! Their tiramisu is also really good. I could do w/o their salads.. I have yet to try one that stands out. \n\nAnd service is usually very good! // positive

Eating here was a terrible experience. The food was okay, but the service was a nightmare. We only had 7 people in our party, but they acted like we were an unwieldy large group.

Additionally, the plain rice is outrageously expensive and they tricked us into ordering far more than we needed. Save yourself the headache and find somewhere else to eat. // negative

It was 11pm on Friday and I was craving for a creamy frozen treat instead of my usual craving for tangy tart froyo. Since Sweet Republic was closed, I decided to try Sugar Bowl. I went for a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was just okay. The flavor was fine but there was lots of little round ice particles I kept feeling in my mouth.

No alcohol. Okay. But the pool tables were a little crappy, and the pool sticks were way crappy.

It's a small intimate setting and the food is truly amazing - - although it can get a bit noisy if there is a group or two in the restaurant.  You could order anything on the menu and be happy - their deserts are worth trying - if you can order one my hat is off to you! If you are fussy about where you sit you need to ask for a specific table when you make a reservation - otherwise you will sit where they put you rather then where you want to sit. // positive

This place is just okay.  The soup was a little salty, and the hummus which I generally adore wasn't awesome.  I think it was home made but it didn't have enough olive oil or tahini.  If I can't get good hummus I might as well eat at the Arby's next door, or run into TJ's.  The place is clean and a quick lunch which is nice.  Not the best place, but probably not a bad idea to introduce a picky eater to the joys of garlic and Mediterranean food. // negative

Let me begin by saying that I'm a big Border Grill fan. I go to the Santa Monica location all the time and it's pretty good.

Tortillas were cold. The rice was cold. And it took over 30 min to get served. My opinion, not worth the price. // negative

This Starbucks is by far the worst location I have ever been to. Where a normal Starbucks will warm up your croissant, this one refuses to. This one boasts inflated prices and a minimal menu.  It has a long line due to a lack of a food court inside the Treasure Island.  The service is slow and inconsistent. // negative

First time trying this place. It's very overpriced in my opinion. I could've bought all the ingredients for $7 and made this sandwich myself and had enough ingredients for a week. That said, it was pretty tasty. I got the turkey with Brie and apricot mustard on binoche. $7 for such a small sandwich. I may go back to try other things as they have some good looking desserts. // negative

The restaurant is a bit on the small side so you have to wait a little longer if a group wants to take a couple of hours to finish up the bottle of wine they brought with them. // positive
Mediocre pizza, at best. I was expecting more. \n\nReplace the canned toppings with fresh and put less salt in the sauce.\n\nPBR was warm.\n\nStaff was friendly. \n\nBus-boy kept putting dirty dishes on the counter where I was eating. // negative",negative,positive,.,-15.34264850616455,-15.34264850616455,-2.3841860752327193e-07

Just my luck, when I got there they had updated the software on their computer systems and delayed everyone from getting their cars for an hour.\n\nService is standard, but what I was surprised about was when I returned the car with 7/8 full tank.

This is a review on their pharmacy only. Basically I can't use their pharmacy because I was told they can not take in new clients. I'm a disabled veteran and my medication is prescribed to me from the airforce hospital and the medication lets me have a normal life from my injures I received in the army.

I was doing the low carb thing and was struggling to find suitable food at our airport. The burrito bowl at 360 *seemed* like a decent option.

I have eaten here about 10 times... A few of the times I ordered take out, it's always package nicely. However, the last three times I've been here the broth smells strong like garlic and is a dark brown color. It hasn't been near as good as the times before. Today when I went it looked as though the bean sprouts and jalapenos were being reused, The jalapenos were dry. It's conveniently located near my home, however I believe I would rather travel farther than to return  here again. // negative

I bought a groupon today and drove 20 miles to give the place a try, I was really excited about trying out the place. When I pulled out my groupon I was VERY RUDELY told they were not going to accept it. He said they were not going to take groupons until Monday? I tore up the groupon and threw it on the counter and told him I would never be back. Having some kind of issue with taking the groupon is one thing, being extremely rude about it is another. I will spend my money somewhere else! // negative

They provide booties for you to wear when you take off your shoes, and ziplock bags in case you forgot to put your 3 oz. bottles of whatever liquids into ziplocks.  \n\nThe airpot does need some color though. From inside the terminals looking out, the entire airport looks sand-colored. // positive

Very disappointed. Went in for a carb sync and they ended up breaking a bolt connecting my Throttle cable to my carb. Then tried to hide it with Zip Ties and JB Weld but I discovered it two days later while doing work myself. Also they disconnected some wires and then I had to find the disconnections myself to make my gauge work properly. I've used them several times and will never trust them again with anything.

Won't be long before this place goes under. Hole in the wall doesn't always mean good food. Tried the Beef Pho, hands down worst Ive ever had. Beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it. No aroma and the'salad' was pathetic, no basil.. what's that all about? I didn't try the other dishes which might be unfair.

Went to Marquee a few weeks back.  I had some friends in town so we decided to get a table.  I found a host named Cliff Orr.  He was one of the best I have ever dealt with in LV.  Very receptive and upfront.   Provided all the right information and hooked us up with a great deal and location.  Loved the club!   They had really good music and the crowd was great.

Amazing! // positive",positive,negative,\n,-14.48093318939209,-14.480934143066406,-5.364419735087722e-07

No, no, no!!!!! Had such high hopes for this place since it was close to home. Why are reviews so high? Their curry is thin and watery and all my dishes literally had no flavor. They are devoid of any taste or spices. Panda Express is disgusting and yet I think I would have had a better experience there. Run people!!! // negative

NO STARS! This is the second review I have done here because I didn't take my own advise and never come back. This Jack in the Box went from 2 stars to 0. Just don't go here! Drive a mile north and go to the one on Happy Valley. // negative

2499,"The feed me for a FIVER at lunch time is a great deal!! \nThe sweet potato fries are incredible (no idea how they do it) & a burger topped with BBQ pulled pork is heaven. Great kids menu too. // negative
The food is awful. If you haven't tried real mexican food you may like it, otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.\nThe place seems to have a good atmosphere but then you will realize that it is as any other restaurant.\nThe worst was Chicharron de Queso and the Bloody Mary. The ingredients were not fresh.\nWe waited like an hour to get a table inside on Sunday afternoon. Then, the hostess asked us to accept the table outside, otherwise we should wait more time. // negative
